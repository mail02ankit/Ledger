# Ledger
**A very simple web app to summarize ledger using the data science tools** 

This project was conceived to help small businesses to understand the growth of their businesses. Here, a ledger file
income.csv file (entries for sales "1" and purchases "0") is used to keep track of transactions. To analyze the growth
of the business [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) are used. A simple web interface
is prepared using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to interactively understand the data and growth.
